# BirdSense

*This README is a work in progress. It will be updated when the project is completed.*

BirdSense is a machine learning project that uses deep learning to identify bird species from images through computer vision. This app leverages the power of Keras, a high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, to achieve highly accurate bird species identification.

## Motivation 
The motivation behind creating BirdSense stems from a love for bird watching and the desire to make bird identification more accessible to everyone. Traditional bird identification requires substantial expertise and experience, which can be a barrier for beginners. BirdSense aims to democratize bird watching by providing an easy-to-use tool that helps users identify bird species with just a photo. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, BirdSense can recognize hundreds of bird species, making it a valuable resource for both amateur bird watchers and seasoned ornithologists.

## How It Works
### Data Collection
The project begins with a comprehensive dataset of bird images, featuring a diverse range of species. The dataset includes labeled images to ensure the model can learn to distinguish between different birds accurately.

### Preprocessing
Before feeding the images into the neural network, they undergo a preprocessing pipeline which includes:
- Resizing: Ensuring all images are the same size.
- Normalization: Standardizing pixel values to improve model performance.
- Augmentation: Applying random transformations (rotations, flips) to increase the robustness of the model.

### Model Training
BirdSense uses Keras to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image recognition tasks. The model architecture consists of multiple layers:

1. Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images.
2. Pooling Layers: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps, retaining the most important information.
3. Fully Connected Layers: Perform the final classification.
4. The model is trained using the labeled dataset, where it learns to associate specific patterns and features with different bird species.

### Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Cross-validation ensures the model's robustness and generalizability to new, unseen images.

### Deployment
After training and evaluation, the model is integrated into a user-friendly mobile application. Users can upload photos of birds, and the app will provide instant identification results, displaying the predicted species along with relevant information about the bird.

### Results
BirdSense achieves high accuracy in identifying bird species, thanks to the powerful combination of deep learning and Keras. The app is capable of recognizing hundreds of bird species with a high degree of reliability.
